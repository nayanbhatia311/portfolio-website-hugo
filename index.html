            <p> I'm Nayan Bhatia, a PhD student specializing in WiFi localization at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My research delves into using Channel State Information (CSI) to advance WiFi-based positioning systems, creating highly accurate, responsive tracking for dynamic indoor and outdoor settings. My goal is to push the limits of what WiFi can achieve in real-time localization, making connectivity smarter and more adaptive to user movement.
In parallel with my research, I developed the UC Essential Needs Navigator, a GPT-powered chatbot that consolidates essential resources for students across all UC campuses. This tool streamlines access to support for housing, food security, academic assistance, and financial aid, offering UC students a user-friendly way to find resources tailored to their needs. I’m driven by a passion for building support systems that bridge accessibility gaps, ensuring every student can quickly find the help they need.</p>
